	<h1>About G. E. Briggs</h1>

    <p>
      G. E. Briggs writes epic fantasy tales of rebels, empires, and the people caught between them. 
      A lifelong storyteller and software engineer by day, he brings a builderâ€™s mindset to world-crafting, 
      creating layered conflicts and characters with real heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Away from the page, he enjoys hiking forest trails, experimenting in the kitchen 
      (often with far too much garlic), and exploring indie games for fresh inspiration. 
      He lives in <em>Pittsburgh</em>, where he is always shaping the next story in his free time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Readers describe his work as a mix of rebellion, strategy, and resilience â€” 
      a reflection of both the epic battles and the quiet struggles that define every world.
